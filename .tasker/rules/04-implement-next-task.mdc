# Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Configuration

This rule uses settings from `.tasker/config/workflow-config.json`:
- **Test file path**: Uses `settings.featuresDirectory` + `/[feature-name]/tests/[task-name].md`
- **Test template**: Uses `templates.test` for consistent test file format
- **Task timeout**: Uses `settings.taskTimeoutDays` for planning guidance

## Prerequisites

This rule should be used after:
- Step 1: PRD has been created (01-create-prd)
- Step 2: Technical roadmap has been generated (02-analyze-codebase)  
- Step 3: Task list has been generated (03-generate-tasks-from-prd)

## Agent Action Steps

### 1. Identify the Next Task
- **Find the first sub-task** in the task list that is not completed (`[ ]`).
- **Do not** start more than one sub-task at a time.
- **Before starting**, ask the user for permission to proceed with the next sub-task. Wait for a clear "yes" or "y" before continuing.

### 2. When Completing a Sub-task
- **Mark the sub-task as completed** by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` in the task list file.
- **Check if all subtasks under the same parent are now `[x]`**:
  - **If yes:**
    - Mark the parent task as completed (`[x]`).
    - Proceed to step 3 (Parent Task Completion).
  - **If no:**
    - Stop and wait for the user's go-ahead before starting the next sub-task.

### 3. When Completing a Parent Task
- **Create a test file** for the parent task:
  - **Path:** Use `settings.featuresDirectory/[feature-name]/tests/[parent-task-name].md` from `.tasker/config/workflow-config.json`.
  - **Template:** Use the test template at the path specified by `templates.test` in the config.
  - **Filename:** Sanitize `[parent-task-name]` for safe filenames (no spaces, special chars).
- **Populate the test file** with:
  - Task Summary (what was accomplished)
  - Implementation Details (key components or functionality added)
  - Manual Test Cases (numbered list of manual tests)
  - Expected Results (for each test)
  - Files Modified (list every file created or modified during this task)
- **Update the "Relevant Files" section** in the task list:
  - Add every file created or modified, with a one-line description of its purpose.
- **Don't continue** implementing the next parent task.

### 4. General Maintenance
- **Always update the task list file** after any significant work.
- **Add new tasks** as they emerge.
- **Keep the "Relevant Files" section accurate and up to date.**
- **Follow all config paths** from `.tasker/config/workflow-config.json` for file operations.

---

## If/Then Triggers
- **If** a sub-task is completed, **then** mark it `[x]` and check if the parent is now complete.
- **If** all subtasks under a parent are `[x]`, **then** mark the parent `[x]` and create the test file.
- **If** a parent task is completed, **then** update the "Relevant Files" section and create the test file.
- **If** you cannot find the config or template, **then** stop and ask the user for help.

---

## Troubleshooting & Reminders for the Agent
- **If you cannot find the correct file path or template,** ask the user for clarification.
- **If you are unsure which task is next,** ask the user.
- **If you encounter an error or missing information,** stop and notify the user before proceeding.
- **Never skip steps or make assumptions.**

## Example Workflow (Checklist for Agent)
- [ ] Ask user for permission to start the next sub-task.
- [ ] Mark sub-task as `[x]` when done.
- [ ] If all subtasks under a parent are `[x]`, mark parent `[x]`.
- [ ] If parent is `[x]`, create test file using config/template.
- [ ] Update "Relevant Files" section.
- [ ] Stop and wait for user approval before next task.

---

**Always follow these steps exactly. Do not proceed to the next task or sub-task without explicit user approval.**
